* First row of dashbaord : total service # time graph; total build # time graph

* Each metric_type a row of two graps : a pie of last 24 hours; the time series graph (ok)

* UT and API coverage (ok)

20210306

"Relase Management Summary dashboard"

* trend graph show sumary curve of all services by metric_field, 

* for Unit/API coverage, show panels of "total service #", show graph " > 80", " 80 > > 50", " > 50" etc

* service # by day, build # by day

* metric/service % 


20210303

* investigate whitesource & fortify etc

* show KPI dashboard which shows only most important metric field

* create a new dashboard (Devops dashboard) for the last two graph, which is affected by repo and branch selection;

* hide repo and branch selection in Relase Management dashboard, since they don't affect the fixed coverage graphs

20210301

* deploy customized Blackbox exporter and get 'restore time'

20210227

* show metrics_type name (ok)

* create a graph for each type (ok)

* set default value of git_brach to 'develop' (ok)

* show only last 3 days in report, more data in trend graph (ok)


20210225

* Investigate how to show unit tests info that has bad coverage

* simplify legend

* add dropdown list to fileter coverage values

20210224

* check kubeconfig-ci.yaml


20210222

* deploy Unit Test coverage metrics monitoring to a production cluster



20210216

It's possible that pods are still running, but service is down. 
- Investigate how to check service health
- most pods should have service but not mandatary
- it's possible that a service has internal problem which leads to malfunction (or not working) but it's not reported in anyway. This case cannot be detected in devops system

20210214

Deployment Frequency
Lead Time for Changes
Time to Restore Services
Change Failure Rate

1) reporting database -> deployment metrics
2) find the git repo for deployment work and find where the deployment events are stored in devPortal
3) production service down -> up duration
time to restore service
Prometheus kubernetes monitoring installation helm chart.
prometheus helm chart monitoring kubernetes metrics
test in black cluster


20210206

1) unit test coverage (~80% with timestamp) metrics (if can't find it, generate fake ones), NOTES, understand better how query work with prometheus data formate
2) install grafana connect to prometheus in devops-dash namespace
3) create dashbaord and then create panel in the dashboard to display trend graph, vertical bar


20210205

New plan :

- find a prometheus exporter that can retrieve data from postgres db using SQL
- get some data and show in grafana

20210204

Plan :

- insall pushgateway in k8s
- kuberctl port-forward pushgateway so that is it accessible on localhost
- run ReportService locally and push to pushgateway whenever 'uploadreport' is called, or daily-report is run

Investigate 
- java (springboot) call Prometheus API
- use Go to write a service
- Prometheus only has REST API? Any java or go native wrap lib?

Problems : 
- It seems the new UI is not working well. GitHub info is not really added. Only the team dashboards created using old UI (run by docker) shows data, and cannot be changed. The new 'Code Repo' widget does not save the github info input into a collectorItem.

20210106

Setup demo : git , jenkins , build

sso , use MongoDB cluster

Next goal : Show 'Build Time' and 'Failed rate' in Build Widget

Plan : 
- run/debug jenkins collector in IntelliJ
- Figure out how jenkins data is retrieved and saved/passed to hygieia
- Figure out how Build Widget shows data
